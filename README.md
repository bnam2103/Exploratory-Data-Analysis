# Project Presentations
## 1. Airbnb in Texas

Author: Nguyen Binh Nam

### Description

This presentation explores the Texas Airbnb dataset to understand how customers can find cost-efficient and high-quality listings. It analyzes the relationships between price, quality, location, and time. The study uses customer ratings and reviews per month as quality metrics and categorizes listings into different price ranges.

Goals

- Identify whether higher prices lead to better quality Airbnbs.

- Examine how neighborhood and location impact the quality of listings.

- Study how time (weekday vs weekend, holidays) influences pricing trends.

- Provide insights into cost-efficient booking strategies for Airbnb customers.

## 2. EDA 2021 Kaggle: ML & Coding Experience

Author: Nguyen Binh Nam

### Description

This project uses the Kaggle 2021 Machine Learning & Data Science Survey dataset, which includes 25,973 responses from the global data science community. The analysis focuses on identifying factors that influence coding experience, including gender, location, age, job type, and programming languages.

Goals

- Determine how demographics (gender, country, age) correlate with years of coding experience.

- Analyze job roles and how they align with skill levels in coding.

- Study the distribution of programming language usage across experience levels.

- Draw insights into trends in data science education and workforce composition.

## 3. Body Fat Prediction

### Author: Nguyen Binh Nam

Description

This presentation examines a small dataset on body fat, density, and body measurements (e.g., abdomen size, height, weight). The project applies regression techniques to predict body fat percentages based on body measurements, performing feature engineering, outlier removal, and model comparison.

Goals

- Build predictive models for body fat using various regression methods.

- Improve accuracy by applying preprocessing techniques such as z-score outlier removal, multicollinearity reduction, and normalization.

- Compare model performances (Bayesian Ridge, Random Forest Regressor, Linear Regression, etc.).

- Identify the most effective approach for small datasets with high dimensionality.
